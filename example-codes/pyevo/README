In addition to EVOWARE, pywin32 and python is required.

Steps:

* Install Python 2.7:
  http://python.org/ftp/python/2.7.1/python-2.7.1.msi

* Install PyWin32
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/pywin32/Build216/pywin32-216.win32-py2.7.exe/download

pyevo.py is the actual module
evoComApi.py is just an autogenerated file from pywin32 that is useful for implementing pyevo.py
ampurexp.py is a protocol written using pyevo - make sure to call AmpureXP() after running all the other commands
interactive.py just starts an interactive shell

Make sure to have a script called InteractiveScript that is the same as BaseScript except with 1 command, MoveRomaHome
