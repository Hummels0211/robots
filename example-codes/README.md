Some codes from other labs:

* csv2gwl

https://github.com/iamatypeofwalrus/csv2gwl

csv2gwl converts a Salk GAL-E lab formatted .CSV file to a valid Tecan EVOware formatted work list file (.GWL). This script is used in conjuction with PCR cherry picking in mind.

* PyEvo

http://people.csail.mit.edu/georgiou/pyevo/doc/

PyEvo provides a python interface to Tecan Robots through the Freedom EVOWare COM API. It allows specifying scripts using higher level abstractions as well as providing an interactive environemnt for interpreted execution of robot scripts written in Python. The interpreted nature allows the Tecan to be controlled from a Read-Eval-Print-Loop as well providing for easy development and debugging.

* pytecan
