# Python scripts for creating arrays of buffers at various pH values with citric acid / phosphate buffers.


* `create-pH-worklist.py` - original experiment to measure compound fluorescence as a function of pH
* `create-pH-worklist-1mL.py` - modified experiment to measure binding affinity as a function of pH, stages to deepwell plates
* `citric-phosphate.txt` - complete range of recipes for available pH
* `citric-phosphate-8.txt` - limited range of 8 conditions
* `ph-worklist.gwl` - example output worklist
