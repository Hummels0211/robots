# Momentum PlateLibrary Notes

## How to use the plate library in Momentum

Thickness
Height
Lidded Height

Low/High/Custom meaning??

Width = 0 means?
Length = 0 means?

Dimensions are only used for lidded/unlidded stacking!!!!

Need to set the offset only (Offset_Low_Z)
Our Orbitor uses the low setting (can be changed in )

Higher Z means high position (into the air)
