    plate_bottom_read : bool (computed)
true if plate can be read from the bottom

    plate_color : enum {clear, black, white, red} (free) (default=black)
the plate color which might be important in the infinite because of light scattering - black is considered good for fluorescence while white is
good for high luminescence. Red looks nice :)

the plate type 96, 384 or 1536

number of wells in x_direction / columns, usually 12, 24 or 48

    plate_numbering : enum {row, column} (default=row)
defines in which direction wells are counted. This is only for convenience and is probably obsolete

length of the container (x_direction, long side), around 125 mm

    flange_type : enum {short, medium, tall, interrupted, dual, none}
The SBS specifications list 5 types for flanges. Which are briefly defined here. The heights have a tolerance of  \pm 0.38 mm. Therefore no field for the actual height is given.
When in doubt choose a higher one to provide correct picking and placement of labels.
- short: height : 2.41 mm
- medum : height : 6.10 mm
- tall : height: 7.62 mm
- interrupted : height : 2.41 mm (like low) and has an interruption (change of height) centered at both long sides. The distance from the interruption to the sides of the plate should be at least 47.8 mm on each side. The height of the interruption should not exceed 6.85 mm
- dual : means short on the short sides 2.41 mm and tall on the long sides 7.62 mm.
- none : not standard, just no flange, like for selfmade parts

    flange_height_short : float [mm] (computed) 
distance between bottom of the plate and end of the flange on the short side. the height gives the actual height including the ledge. I am actually not sure what flange height for the Infinite means but I guess thats this coincides with the flange height. At least numbers kind og match. This might be listed in a newer manual of i-control 1.10.
This defines the region where the orbitor or roma canNOT or should NOT grip. for dual mode this refers to the short side (the y-direction in the normal orientation). Short side height is given is flange_height_short.
height of the flange of the short side. Only necessary is type is dual. Otherwise it is the same as flange_height_long

    flange_height_long : float [mm] (computed) 
height of the flange of the long side. Only necessary is type is dual. Otherwise it is the same as flange_height_short. See flange_height_short or flange_type for more details

    flange_width : float [mm] (optional)
the thickness of the flange, which is supposed to be at least 1.27 mm. Is not needed for gripping since the gripping is usually not on the flange.

    stacking_above : bool (default=true)
true if plates are allowed to be put on top (above)

    stacking_below : bool (default=true)
true if plates are allowed to be put under this plate (below)

    stacking_plate_height : float [mm]
Effective height if container is stacked. Note that this height is for the container itself, if it is stacked upon another plate. So, if two plates are stacked, the lower one has full height and the top one uses its stacking_height

    stacking_plate_shift : float [mm] (computed)
distance the plate is lower when stacked. Should be plate_height - stacking_plate_height 

    well_size : enum {full, half, low, deep} (default=full)
This is for convenience. In principle all well parameters should allow to determine the area and thus if it is a half of full. Also low should be deducible from well_depth 

    well_coating : enum {none, nonbonding} (default=none) (free)
coating material of the well

    well_shape : enum {rectangle, round, square, nodged, unknown} (default=round)
top shape of a well. Usually 'round' for 96-well and 'square' for 384/1536-well plates. Nodged seemed to be used for 384 / 1536 plates to increase stability at the well joints.
This rounds the corners 

    well_bottom : enum {clear, solid, UV} (free)
material type of the bottom of the well

    well_profile : enum {flat, round, ushape, vshape, octo, unknown} (default=flat)
bottom shape of a well. Here EVO and Infinite (both Tecan!!!) are inconsistent. 
Infinite allows for round and U_shape, which seem to be different, while EVO only defines 
round which seems to match Infinites U_shape. We wills stick with the Infinite definition 
and treat round and U_shape both as U_shape in the EVO. This might reduce the 
actual volume a little. In general we will assume that
- flat : is just flat. 
- u : means a (upto) half sphere that matches with outgoing straight walls
- v : means straight lines from the center in an angle of 'well_profile_angle'
- round : means a half_sphere that cuts off at 45 degrees and V_shape means an angle of 45 degrees. We also assume for now that only flat bottoms allow for rectangular well shapes. Also, in standard plates wells are square or round. And momentum doesn't care - no pipetting...
- octagon : for Corning, like 'v' but allows for a bottom_diameter larger than zero. This way it looks like an octagon.
This means that (in principle) we could remove 'v' and 'flat'

    well_profile_anlge : enum {0, 22.5, 30.0, 45.0, 60.0, max} (optional) (free) (default=30.0)
only for the 'v' and 'octogon' shape and determines the angle in which the v shape is formed. 
Usually between 30 and 45 degrees. A zero angle is equivalent to flat, and max stops at the top end of the well.

    well_diameter_bottom : float [mm]
the diameter of the bottom shape. 

    well_diameter_bottom_long : float [mm] (optional) (empty=well_diameter_bottom)

    well_diameter_top : float [mm]
inner diameter of a well. If non-symmetric then this is the shorter side

    well_diameter_top_long : float [mm] (optional) (empty=well_diameter_top)
inner diameter of the longer side of a well. For round and square wells this is ignored

    well_position_first_x : float [mm]

y position of the center of A1

    well_distance_x : float [mm] (optional)

    well_distance_y : float [mm] (optional) (empty=well_distance_x)
x distance between two neighboring centers. Should be 9.00mm, 4.50mm or 2.25mm. If not specified than 

    well_position_last_x : float [mm] (computed)
x position of the center of H12 / P24, ...
The x distance between 1 and 12/24 should be 
- 99.0 mm = (12-1) rows * 90 mm  (96-well plates)
- 103.5 mm = (24-1) rows * 45 mm   (384-well plates)
- 105.75 mm = (48-1) rows * 22.5 mm   (1536-well plates)

If not specified this distance is used

    well_position_last_y : float [mm] (optional) (computed)
y position of the center of H12 / P24, ...
The y distance between A and H/P should be 
- 63.0 mm = (8-1) rows * 90 mm  (96-well plates)
- 67.5 mm = (16-1) rows * 45 mm   (384-well plates)
- 69.75 mm = (48-1) rows * 22.5 mm   (1536-well plates)
